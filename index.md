    intro: Originally written for the BlackWidow Chroma, the driver is now compatible with 123 Razer peripherals.
    keyboard:
    mice:
    mousemat:
    keypads: A third party application is required for key rebinding, such as [input-remapper](https://github.com/sezanzeb/input-remapper/).
    headset: Only lighting features are supported. OpenRazer doesn't provide additional audio features.
    other: Webcams with no lighting features are not supported. Try [cameractrls](https://github.com/soyersoyer/cameractrls) to enable HDR and related functionality.

    Before installing the driver, you'll need to install a kernel headers package that matches your kernel version.
    This is because the driver is "out-of-tree" and needs to be compiled for the kernel (using DKMS).


    For example, Arch has `linux-headers` and `linux-lts-headers`.
    Other distros like Ubuntu/Debian may install them automatically, as the packaging system "recommends" the necessary package.


    Before using OpenRazer, you'll need to add your user to the `plugdev` group. In most distributions, this is:

        sudo gpasswd -a $USER plugdev


    After following the instructions for your distribution below, a **system reboot** is essential
    so the driver and user group permissions take effect. **Secure boot** may
    need to be disabled due to the nature of the driver being unsigned.


    After successful installation, reboot the computer and [pick an application](#apps) to interact with the driver.

      summary: We provide packages for these distros.
      distros:
        - name: Debian
          id: debian
          logo: /img/distros/debian.svg
          instructions: >-
            Starting with Debian 10, OpenRazer is available from the [official repositories](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=openrazer).
            However, you may need to install our package if your device was added in a newer version.


            Instructions and downloadable builds for Debian are
            [available from the openSUSE Build Service.](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=hardware%3Arazer&package=openrazer-meta)

        - name: Fedora
          id: fedora
          logo: /img/distros/fedora.svg
          instructions: >-

            Due to a bug in Fedora, the wrong kernel headers (`kernel-debug-devel`) may be installed and cause OpenRazer to fail installation.
            To fix this, you must install `kernel-devel` explictly before installing OpenRazer:

                sudo dnf install kernel-devel

            For Fedora 41 (and later), run the following:

                sudo dnf config-manager addrepo --from-repofile=https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/hardware:/razer/Fedora_$(rpm -E %fedora)/hardware:razer.repo

                sudo dnf install openrazer-meta

            For Fedora Rawhide, run the following:

                sudo dnf config-manager addrepo --from-repofile=https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/hardware:/razer/Fedora_Rawhide/hardware:razer.repo

                sudo dnf install openrazer-meta

            For Fedora 40 (and earlier), run the following:

                sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/hardware:/razer/Fedora_$(rpm -E %fedora)/hardware:razer.repo

                sudo dnf install openrazer-meta

            Starting with 20.04, OpenRazer is available from the [official repositories](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=openrazer).
            However, you may need to install our package if your device was added in a newer version.


            elementaryOS users need to install a prerequisite first:

                sudo apt install software-properties-gtk

            To install the latest release, add this PPA:

                sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openrazer/stable

            Or for latest development builds:

                sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openrazer/daily

            After adding the PPA, install the packages:

                sudo apt update
                sudo apt install openrazer-meta

            If you get dependency errors when trying to install the driver packages, please make sure that you have enabled the "universe" repository in **Software & Updates**.

          instructions: >-
            To enable the OpenRazer module in NixOS, add this snippet to your `configuration.nix`:

                hardware.openrazer.enable = true;

            In order to run the openrazer-daemon service, your user needs to be part of the `openrazer` group.

                hardware.openrazer.users = ["<name>?"];

            Rebuild your NixOS configuration:

                sudo nixos-rebuild switch

            Alternately, use `nix-shell`:

                nix-shell -p openrazer-daemon

          instructions: >-
            While SteamOS is based on Arch Linux, SteamOS is built differently and is more involved. Due to the immutable filesystem, you may need to reinstall OpenRazer after a system update.
